# Apostle::Rails

Rails Bindings for Apostle

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'apostle-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install apostle-rails

## Usage

`apostle-rails` is designed to feel like the `ActionMailer` API as much as possible.

Changing an existing mailer is easy.

```ruby
class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
	def my_mail name, email, message
		@message, @name = message, name
		mail to: email, subject: "Your message"
	end
end
```
becomes
```ruby
class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base

	include Apostle::Mailer

	def my_mail name, email, message
		@message, @name = message, name
		mail "my_mail", email: email
	end
end
```

The first param passed to `mail` is the template slug, and instead of `to`, use `email`. `Apostle::Mailer` automatically adds any instance variables you set to the `Apostle::Mail` instance.

Instead of returning an `ActionMailer` object when `MyMailer.my_mail` you get an instance of `Apostle::Mail`, which  you can then call `deliver` on.

```ruby
MyMailer.
	my_mail("Mal Curtis", "mal@mal.co.nz", "Hi there").
	deliver!
```
